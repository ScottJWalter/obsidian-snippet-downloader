# Obsidian Snippet Downloader

This plugin is here to help you to download and update css snippet that are on a GitHub repository.

The plugin will download all css snippet on a repository, unless :
- There are two big (< 1MB)
- There are named `obsidian.css` (use BRAT for themes)
- There are excluded (see settings & excluded)

In setting, you can :
- Delete a repository. Warning ! It will not delete the snippet from your `.obsidian/snippet` folder.
- Exclude file from the download / update. You can use the name, or a wildcard. 


So, the commands added by the plugins are :
- **Adding new Snippet** : Use `https://github.com/username/repo` or `username/repo` to add a new repository and download the present css snippet.
- **Update all snippet** : Update all repository and their snippet (unless you exclude them).
- **Update Specific snippet** : You can just update one snippet using its name.
- **Update Specific Repository** : You can just update one repository using its name.

💡Note : The file will be updated only if there is a new commit ! It's not based on the file contents.

Also, alternatively, you can use the settings tab to add a repository, delete a repository, exclude a snippets, etc.

💡If one day BRAT-42 or Obsidian add a similary function, this plugin will be deleted !
